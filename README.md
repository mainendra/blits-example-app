# Blits L3 Example App

## Getting started

Clone this repository and run `npm install` in the project root.

Then run `npm run dev` to start the dev server and open the URL printed in your terminal to check the App.

This Blits L3 Example App contains a demo of a TMBD integration. Head over to https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction to get your own TMDB API key and paste it inside a `.env` file (following the example in `.example.env`). To use your own TMDB API key, you also need to change `VITE_TMDB_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file to `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`.

You can also take a look at the [hosted version](http://blits-demo.lightningjs.io) of this App.
